                                According to section 7 first paragraph of the German Telemedia Act, DLR as the content
                                provider is responsible for its own content which it provides for use on this website
                                in
                                accordance with the general laws. Cross-references ("links") to content provided by
                                other
                                content providers must
                                be
                                distinguished from DLR´s own content. By means of the cross-reference DLR provides
                                third-party content for use
                                which
                                is
                                marked accordingly by the indication "[external]" or by a link. Before setting the link
                                DLR
                                checks this
                                third-party
                                content if it causes possible civil or criminal liability. However, it cannot be
                                excluded
                                that the third-party
                                content
                                providers change their content afterwards. DLR does not constantly check the third-party
                                content it refers to
                                for
                                changes made by the third-party content providers which could engender DLR´s civil or
                                criminal liability. If you
                                believe
                                that the linked external sites violate applicable laws or otherwise have inappropriate
                                content, please let us
                                know.
